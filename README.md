[![scriptures](https://snapcraft.io/scriptures/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/scriptures)

### A simple way to read the Standard Works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. English only.

## Special thanks to:
    * The LDS Documentation Project - https://scriptures.nephi.org/
    * @beandog for all the hard work that went into compiling the Scriptures. Without this work, this simple "app" wouldn't be possible.
